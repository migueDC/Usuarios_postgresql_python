# Usuarios_postgresql_python
This repository is to share with you this project that I did when I was in a python course in Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/universidad-python-desde-cero-hasta-experto-django-flask-rest-web/). In it I use DB, POO and python.

I did the program with this classes, maybe It couldn't work in your computers because I connect to my local postgres database.

I would like to heard your opinions.
